# Incremental mafia

Incremental mafia is an experimental browser game made mainly for learning purposes. It features the following frameworks and technologies:

* Laravel as PHP framework
* Vue.js as MVVM
* jQuery for DOM manipulation and ajax requests to the server.

## The game

The game's objective is the one of any incremental game, basically you keep playing in order to earn points. In this case, you earn influence points.
The more IP you gain, the more soldiers you can gain where you can buy more soldiers.

Even though the game could've been completely JS based I wanted to play around with Vue.js and laravel together.
